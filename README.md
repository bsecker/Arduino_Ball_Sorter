# Arduino_Ball_Sorter
Robotics (RBT200) Ball sorter project.


Files:

pygameCamera.py - the python code that will be used on the raspberry pi. Contains code for the camera and writing serial commands to the arduino. Prerequisites: PyGame 1.9.1, python 2.7.x

ball_sorter.ino - the arduino code for the ball sorter. Contains code that converts serial messages to servo movement and co-ordinates two servos.

colour_sensor.ino - depreciated code for the analogue TCS230 colour sensor module. Shamelessly stolen off the internet and no longer used.
